I am applying Computer Science(MASc) in UBC for further research into computer architecture, and promoting better system designs with deeper knowledge of machine learning.
Basically, in my future academic career, I am looking forward to three things: plenty of research training including surveying methods, doing experiments to test the methods, and structuring these processes with ideas into formal reports along with oral presentations. Since machine learning is changing how web search engines match documents and queries, thus changing the system design of searching engine and brings difference in disk storage size, computation hardwares, I want to go deeper on why the deep learning networks are efficient in these scenarios, and whether there are other system architectures that could be disrupted by deep learning networks.
My past experience is generally related to computer science and its applications. I received the BEng in Software Engineering from Dalian University of Technology in 2021, graduating with distinction. Courses are appealing to me including Descrete Maths, Probability and Statics, Operating System, and Compiler Technology.
After completing most of my courses in the first two years of my undergraduate, I went to Pin Duo Duo and Byte Dance for internships as a Software Engineer out of the curiosity to the industry. During the internship, the company&rsquo;s systematic design process impredded me most, which made it viable to write programs for a reasonably intricate task in industry scenarios. Also, I acquired a further scope of multithread programming and how to design a better user inferface for an APP.
Inspired by the Remote Procedure Call(RPC) network framework we used in Byte Dance,  I completed my thesis on designing a flexible raffic control strategy and implementing it within my handwritten RPC, under Professor Zhilei Ren. When tracking online latency problems in Byte Dance, I found that the retry limit in an RPC would substantially increase the traffic when the downstream requests collapse, and the long latency requests will fail after the retry if the latency is induced by the query itself. Therefore, I proposed two features to achieve the sooth traffic: global retry limit and task discarding limit. For the experiment, I conducted tests on a fixed number of calculation services in a trace, with random failures and a fixed QPS of requests, and collected the latency quantiles of the requests under baseline(scheduling without my features) and strategy. Data proved that my ideas worked out when improving the 999 quantile latency.
During the process I also had ideas that long latency requests could be predicted based on query features, machine states and previous latancy. And for the predicted long latency requests, they could be sent parallel to reduce the synchronized waiting time. If we see This ideas inspired me to apply some inference model to forecast whether the query would be a long latency one. I also observed that in different services, the long latency distribution varies, so which service the request is in is also an important feature, and different services should have a different definition of what is long. It was at that time that I realised that machine learning could optimize the system in a more macro way.
With the curiosity of machine learning and system, after graduation, I decided to work in Baidu. Our team focuses on efficient deep learning computing and constructing reliable online inference services, issuing throughput and latency.</p>
<p>My kick off in Baidu is a feature called Dynamic Batch. since we do inference on GPU, if the batch size of the tensors to be predicted is larger, GPU could perform a better throughput than a single batch. However, upstream services may need to introduce an on-time-consuming queue to accumulate the batch, which is costly. Therefore, I conducted to have a queue before prediction, and it is consumed at the moment the last prediction is done. Things are not that easy after the multithread-consumingqueue is introduced. Comsuming loops should detect signals, the first prediction should be set free, and I have to slice the output after the dynamic batch. Moreover, there is a memory leak in the code, and the new feature costing more memory exposed the problem. After testing the precision difference and performance, and the code was online, I was nervous but also proud to be challenged, and it was so great to dig deep into the codes and to carry out solutions thoroughly.
During the one-and-a-half years&rsquo; work, I was thrilled when I successfully abstracted the repetitive code in a systematic way on the Click-Through-Rate project. Also, I got a chance to learn about TVM(a deep learning complier), and when I look into it, I realised that I am desiring about the feeling of digisting into an unfamiliar field and slowly uncover the hidden logic underneath layers of APIs.
As to the awards, Our team in Baidu is honored with Super star project(2022 Q2) for designing and developing searching system on large scale inference models, and I am honored with Ownership prize for outstanding responsibility and tackling complicated online problems. During my former study, I won the HIWIN Elite Student Scholarship as an outstanding undergraduate. I also took an active part in Mathematical Contest In Modeling, and earned an Honorable Mention. Besides, I love coding in hackathons with new friends, and gained the first prize in the PKU Hackathon in 2020.
I am applying to the University of the University of British Columbia because the interests of the Systopia lab closely match my own. I am looking forward to going deeper in machine learning and system research. Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>小作文之：debug热情正在高涨
My love for doing research and the sense of ownership are keys to being a strong candidate.
The passion for exploring more about computer architecture and applying what I learnt into real life experience is surging while I am working on AI model deployment and optimization in Baidu. When I am challenged by technical problems, I instinctly look for thorough solutions.
During my work on Model Service in Baidu, there was a service level memory leak problem online, with cores dumped. Debugging with GDB, I checked the memory address of each related variable, but there was only chaos. Based on the memory model, I proposed that the memory would be written by other threads while doing multithread calculation, and the reason why other threads could cut in is that the current thread is not bounding a correct memory buffer. Finally, with the help of closing the GDB optimized level and printing the buffer of the variables&rsquo; memory. I found it was the tensor written with a wrong length after it was moved out from Paddle Inference Engine. It was not discovered because the memory that the tensor uses is not visited by other threads, just by chance. Meanwhile, with over two years of industrial experience, my programming skills and computer architecture knowledge are tested by billions of online traffic through online services and online cases.</p>
<p>一点概括</p>
<p>Why do you consider yourself to be a strong candidate? What sets you apart from other applicants? For example, have you placed well in CTFs, programming competitions, or hackathons? Have you published peer-reviewed research? Have you won any significant awards? Have you done significant community service? Have you participated in sports or joined a performance group?</p>

With over two years of industrial experience, my programming skills and computer architecture knowledge are tested by billions of online traffic through online services and online cases. Also, my working experience in the companies also prints me a big picture of system design and how to operate a large scale system along with human resources.
Previously, when I was a student, the computer was always a joy of mine. Programming language is a magic tool to perform my ideas into solid logic and hardware is the platform that runs the logic and realizes them in real life. I took an active part in    National Information Olympics since my high school, and in my undergraduate I am fond of Mathematical Contest In Modeling because I could do complete research into interesting social problems with a team of people and report our ideas formally. I also joined coding competitions including CCF/CSP, ACM training, and Women Techmakers coding game held at school, and got a top 2% C++ programming skill certification by China Computer Federation, and I enjoy the feeling of nervous when I have to work out problems within the time limit and space limit. Besides, I love hackathons, and took part in PKU Hackathon by designing and implementing Dining Review Info Flow in Campus with four partners within 30 hours.
Generally, computer science is my passion, and I will chase my dream no matter where I am.</p>
